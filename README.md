# heart-disease-prediction

The content of this work focuses primarily on the application of Machine Learning methods that will be used to predict whether a given patient has a heart disease. 
The behavior of the data was executed and described using the following methods: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes classifier, and logistic regression. 
The application of these methods was preceded by preliminary data analysis, examining the impact of explanatory variables on the explained variable, and appropriate data preparation.
